Java Thread Performance Comparison

This project demonstrates and compares the performance of different threading models in Java: Single-threaded execution, Multi-threaded execution using Thread class and Thread pool execution using ExecutorService

I have also used Apache JMeter to test and benchmark each threading approach under different loads. The goal is to analyze how each threading model performs in terms of throughput, latency, and scalability.

Technologies Used :Java 17, Apache JMeter

Things I have learnt from this Project 1.How different threading models work in Java 2.Performance implications of threading 3.How to use JMeter for performance testing
